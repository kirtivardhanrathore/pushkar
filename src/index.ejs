            Pushkar is a small town in Rajasthan; a 15 min drive from Ajmer. Popularly known as â€˜Tirthraj Pushkar' as it houses the only Bramha temple in the world. Pushkar is also known for its annual Camel fair and crazy Holi celebrations. 
          <br><br>
          I have spent around a year and a half in Ajmer and Pushkar was always my go-to place. During my visits there, I have been to the famous Camel Fair, attended concerts by various bands, eaten at numerous cafes, and visited nearly all the temples.
